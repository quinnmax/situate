when situate tries to load models from "saved_models," if that directory doesn't exist, it crashes.
make sure that it just creates that directory if it doesn't already exist.

x the gt IOU is not correct in the workspace. 
	check for when it's adjusted to make sure the correct boxes are being compared (and that the workspace entry is being properly updated when something goes in and is replaced)
	update: added an additional check of correct gt IOU in the main_loop and couldn't reproduce this

x initialize pool with rcnn data
	add the new RCNN pre-computed box files, make sure that pipeline works properly
	currently crashes because i wanted to check the string comparison
	right now, trying to use the information in the situation structure to automatically pick a directory from the rcnn folder
	just include the directory that contains the relevant rcnn data as an arg?

	"agent_pool_initialization_function" : "@(a,b,c,d) situate.agent.pool_initialize_rcnn(a,b,c,d,10,30);"

	 vs

	"agent_pool_initialization_function" : "@(a,b,c,d) situate.agent.pool_initialize_rcnn(a,b,c,d,10,30,{'rcnn box data/dogwalking/});",

	always have rcnn boxes that match situation objects

	mapping from csv data to situation objects is sorta complicated
	person1 person2, vs person
	person_left person_right


x training iou regression classifier
	there's a display when running trust rounds that is unclear

x loading pre-extracted features mat
 	lots of warnings
	mat has p_struct in it, which has anon functions, which look for their original source in a hardcoded path. not actually used though

	that file should just be the pre-extracted features
	
	a separate function should learn a conditional model and estimate external and total support functions

x melanie's warnings when starting up matlab

continue to update analysis code

have an explicit setting for the max number of boxes taken from the rcnn like mechanism

i think the way we have it may create a second attempted entry advantage
	box a is checked in for person 1
	box b is attempted for person 1, rejected
	box a is attempted for person 2, accepted, replaces existing entry for person 1 (higher external support)
	now we've already tried box b for person 1 and moved on, so won't get another shot

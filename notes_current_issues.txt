when situate tries to load models from "saved_models," if that directory exists, it crashes.
make sure that it just creates that directory if it doesn't already exist.

the gt IOU is not correct in the workspace. 
check for when it's adjusted to make sure the correct boxes are being compared (and that the workspace entry is being properly updated when something goes in and is replaced)

add the new RCNN pre-computed box files, make sure that pipeline works properly

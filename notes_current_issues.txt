before making code public

	x clean out tools folder

	x clean up the image label loader

	x analysis script
		one for grounding analysis
		one for retrieval analysis
		one for outputting final workspaces (subjective) 
		(change naming convention of saved workspaces, situation score, gt pos-neg)
		one that calls all of them
		
		one for agent-level analysis (good for setting up detailed analyses)
		
	x put into it's own little package

	another pass at the readme (esp wrt analysis scripts)

	save off results more often (every 100 images or so)

	see if saved structure for per-agent records can be made smaller. what all is being saved?



experiments for paper

	situations
		dogwalking
		handhsaking
		pingpong
	data
		positives test set
		large negatives set
		hard-negatives set
	parameters
		uniform
		naive faster rcnn (just top box -> situation score)
		situate as proposed 
			detection-based classifier (not iou est)
			fixed internal-external support values
			local search, no box-adjust
		situate final
			iou estimation classifier
			internal-external support based on AUROC
			box-adjust
			pool priming with rcnn
		situate with faster-rcnn boxes
			(same, but faster-rcnn boxes for priming)
	
		


other outstanding issues

	removing good boxes from workspace and not putting them back into the pool
		i think the way we have it may create a second-attempted-entry advantage with some of the 
		box a is checked in for person 1
		box b is attempted for person 1, rejected
		box a is attempted for person 2, accepted, replaces existing entry for person 1 (higher external support)
		now we've already tried box b for person 1 and moved on, so won't get another shot

	total support should be individual object features, box parameters support, each pair support, full situation support



old issues

	x when situate tries to load models from "saved_models," if that directory exists, it crashes.

	x the gt IOU is not correct in the workspace. 
	check for when it's adjusted to make sure the correct boxes are being compared (and that the workspace entry is being properly updated when something goes in and is replaced)

	x add the new RCNN pre-computed box files, make sure that pipeline works properly

	x include workspace / gt reconciliation as a function external to 

	x in the results file, copy the experiment script, situation struct, and situate parameters used in the run

	x when situate tries to load models from "saved_models," if that directory doesn't exist, it crashes.
	make sure that it just creates that directory if it doesn't already exist.

	x the gt IOU is not correct in the workspace. 
		check for when it's adjusted to make sure the correct boxes are being compared (and that the workspace entry is being properly updated when something goes in and is replaced)
		update: added an additional check of correct gt IOU in the main_loop and couldn't reproduce this

	x initialize pool with rcnn data
		add the new RCNN pre-computed box files, make sure that pipeline works properly
		currently crashes because i wanted to check the string comparison
		right now, trying to use the information in the situation structure to automatically pick a directory from the rcnn folder
		just include the directory that contains the relevant rcnn data as an arg?

		"agent_pool_initialization_function" : "@(a,b,c,d) situate.agent.pool_initialize_rcnn(a,b,c,d,10,30);"

		 vs

		"agent_pool_initialization_function" : "@(a,b,c,d) situate.agent.pool_initialize_rcnn(a,b,c,d,10,30,{'rcnn box data/dogwalking/});",

		always have rcnn boxes that match situation objects

		mapping from csv data to situation objects is sorta complicated
		person1 person2, vs person
		person_left person_right


	x training iou regression classifier
		there's a display when running trust rounds that is unclear

	x loading pre-extracted features mat
	 	lots of warnings
		mat has p_struct in it, which has anon functions, which look for their original source in a hardcoded path. not actually used though

		that file should just be the pre-extracted features
		
		a separate function should learn a conditional model and estimate external and total support functions

	x melanie's warnings when starting up matlab

	x continue to update analysis code

	x have an explicit setting for the max number of boxes taken from the rcnn like mechanism

	x issue with negative images in the visualizer

	x check that analysis code works with only negative images

	x include figures that show top results in positives, negatives, false pos, and false neg

	x install matconvnet if not already installed

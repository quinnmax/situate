x when situate tries to load models from "saved_models," if that directory exists, it crashes.

x the gt IOU is not correct in the workspace. 
check for when it's adjusted to make sure the correct boxes are being compared (and that the workspace entry is being properly updated when something goes in and is replaced)

x add the new RCNN pre-computed box files, make sure that pipeline works properly

x include workspace / gt reconciliation as a function external to 

x in the results file, copy the experiment script, situation struct, and situate parameters used in the run



before making code public

	clean out tools folder

	x clean up the image label loader

	analysis script
		one for grounding analysis
		one for retrieval analysis
		one for outputting final workspaces (subjective) 
		(change naming convention of saved workspaces, situation score, gt pos-neg)
		one that calls all of them
		
		one for agent-level analysis (good for setting up detailed analyses)
		
		put into it's own little package

	another pass at the readme (esp wrt analysis scripts)



experiments for paper

	situations
		dogwalking
		handhsaking
		pingpong
	data
		positives test set
		large negatives set
		hard-negatives set
	parameters
		uniform
		naive faster rcnn (just top box -> situation score)
		situate as proposed 
			detection-based classifier (not iou est)
			fixed internal-external support values
			local search, no box-adjust
		situate final
			iou estimation classifier
			internal-external support based on AUROC
			box-adjust
			pool priming with rcnn
		situate with faster-rcnn boxes
			(same, but faster-rcnn boxes for priming)

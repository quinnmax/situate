parameter setting experiments (redux)
	I have them in order of what I think could break the system. Parameters checked later will have to have best-guesses during runs for the parameters being checked earlier, so we should make sure the big stuff is figured out first and the little things are tuned after.

	threshold on internal support for box-adjust model (currently at .2)
		proposed values: [ .1 .2 .3 .4 .5] 
		(last time best was between .1 and .2, but it seems like we need it to go up quite a bit given changes, so we might want to do this twice based on what we find)

	total support threshold (currently at .5625)
		proposed values: [.45 .5 .55 .6 .65] 
		(last time best was between .56 and .625)

	provisional support threshold (currently not being used)
		last time we found not using provisional check-ins to be best, so we could just skip this

		it seems like the usefulness of provisional check-ins is obviated by using the box-adjust model, but we could give it another go

	two-toned box-adjust high or low variance model cutoff (currently .5)
		proposed values: [.2 .3 .4 .5 .6]

		this is currently just set based on the original observation about the two box-adjust models and their training data. 

	probability of uniform when using uniform normal mix (currently at .5)
		proposed values: [.2 .3 .4 .5 .6]
		(last time best was between .25 and .5)

	value of post-detection urgency (currently at .25)
		proposed values: [0 .1 .25 .5 1.0]
		(last time didn't matter too much, but not sure how many such agents were being generated)




	separately, for local search
		use above results for: 
			total support threshold
			probability of uniform
			post-detection urgency

		threshold on internal support for generating local agents
			proposed values: [.5 .6 .65 .7 .8]
		(	last time best was .65, but want to make sure nothing significant has changed)
